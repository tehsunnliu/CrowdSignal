**Welcome to CrowdSignal** 

**About**

CrowdSignal is a Web3 prediction and incentive platform designed to transform collective insight into verifiable signals.

Instead of relying on capital, speculation, or opaque algorithms, CrowdSignal allows users to participate in predictions using reputation and participation. Correct insights are rewarded with points, creating a transparent and low risk way to surface high quality signals from the crowd.

The platform focuses on three core ideas: prediction, attention, and community participation. By incentivizing content creation and engagement, CrowdSignal turns public discussion and collective judgment into measurable signals that can be evaluated over time.

CrowdSignal is not a gambling or betting application. Users do not stake or risk assets. All participation is based on interaction, contribution, and accuracy. This makes the system more accessible, safer, and suitable for long term ecosystem growth.

The initial version of CrowdSignal is built with an off chain first architecture to ensure fast iteration, cost efficiency, and security. The design allows future upgrades toward deeper decentralization, reputation weighting, and on chain settlement where appropriate.

CrowdSignal is intended to serve as a growth and coordination layer for Web3 ecosystems, helping projects convert attention into meaningful participation while strengthening community consensus.
